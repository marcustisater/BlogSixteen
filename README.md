# Hi, I am Blog Sixteen the WordPress Theme.

Customize me with colors through a GUI and create awesome content for you're website. You can set a background-image, decide colors for my buttons, menu, title and text. I use Roboto and Raleway as font for the content. I am modernaly built with flexbox and also maintained on a regular basic to keep up with the latest stuff and to solve bugs and also build new functions for the website.

Developers can use me as a base theme and also work with some of the more modern tools today in a dev-branch. I am based from underscores.me skeleton theme so big shoutout to the guys at Automattic.

I was built in one day so please be open and wait for more awesome updates to come.

Enjoy!
